    <div id="text"><p>Multa is a collaborative practice which aims to democratise critical discourse through honest and transparent methodologies, using design and theoretical research as platforms. 
We seek to reflect upon and mediate narratives that must be acknowledged in order to produce meaningful change.</p>
        <p>Multa (portuguese for fine; penalty; mulct) calls upon the politics of reprobation, upon reprobation as accountability. Holding systems accountable by scrutinising what laid their foundations and unearthing them, presenting hopeful alternatives through imagination.
